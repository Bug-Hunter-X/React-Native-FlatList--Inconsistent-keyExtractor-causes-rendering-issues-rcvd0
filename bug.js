This React Native bug occurs when using the FlatList component with a large dataset and the keyExtractor prop is not properly set or is inconsistent.  This leads to incorrect rendering, performance issues, and unexpected behavior such as items disappearing or being duplicated. The keyExtractor prop is crucial for FlatList to identify unique items efficiently, and a missing or improperly implemented keyExtractor often results in slow rendering and visual glitches.
